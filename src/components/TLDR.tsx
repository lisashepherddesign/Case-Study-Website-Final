                  I entered this independent study wanting to understand vibe coding, a new way of building software through collaboration with AI.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I learned there are four main modes: no-code, low-code, agentic AI, and CLI. I used all four constantly.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I experimented with tools like Figma Make, ChatGPT, VS Code, Vite, Netlify, Lovable, and Base44.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  My big project, Dream Note, became the most challenging part of this study and taught me more than its final result.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I learned that AI is powerful, but it is not magic. You still need clarity, prompting skills, and patience.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Vibe coding showed me how designers can build more than they think, even without being traditional developers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The real takeaway: there is no "correct" way to vibe code. It is creative, chaotic, experimental, and surprisingly effective when you lean into it.
